<h1 align='center'> Shaun's eCommerce Project </h1>
<h2 align='center'> Currently a Work In Progress.</h2>


<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>To learn how to greatly reduce API requests and response times. 
<br />This is done mainly with RTK-Query as well as NextJs static pages. 
<br/>The website style is a copy of ASOS. I have no intention of profiting from this. It's merely practice. </p>

<h3>Tooling / features </h3>

  * React Toolkit Query 
  * NextJS
  * NodeJs server
  * Netlify & Heroku

This eCommerce site allows a user to buy clothes and manage a user account. The aim is to create a site with as fast as possible server interactions and as few requests as possible. 



The main tools worth mentioning are  
  - RTK query
  - Typescript 
  - NextJS 

Minor tools such as Mongoose, Bcrypt or express don't seem worth the mention. 

Mobile responsiveness will not be setup. At this point it seems like an inneffective use of time. 

UPCOMING FEATURES 
  - Error handling in nodeJs. There is none currently. 
  - A Larger data pool to better test the speed of server requests. 
  - A security feature for removing localStorage data when 'expiresAt' elapses.
