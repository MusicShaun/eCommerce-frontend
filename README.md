<h1 align='center'> Shaun's eCommerce Project </h1>
<h2 align='center'> Currently a Work In Progress.</h2>


<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>To learn how to greatly reduce API requests and response times. 
<br />This is done mainly with RTK-Query as well as NextJs. 
<br/>The website style is a copy of ASOS. I have no intention of profiting from this. It's merely practice. </p>

<h3>Tooling / features </h3>

  * React Toolkit Query 
  * NextJS
  * NodeJs server
  * Netlify & Heroku


<h4>What does it do?</h4>

  * The user can login or signup with JWT authentication.
  * Can simply make one-click to create an anonymous guest account. 
  * Or create a user profile. 
  * Super fast page navigation. 
  * Displays clothes for sale. 
  * Can sort clothes either through navigation or the search bar. 
  * Has a very specific search page for users looking for the exact item. 




The main tools worth mentioning are  
  - RTK query
  - Typescript 
  - NextJS 

Minor tools such as Mongoose, Bcrypt or express don't seem worth the mention. 

Mobile responsiveness will not be setup. At this point it seems like an inneffective use of time. 

UPCOMING FEATURES 
  - Error handling in nodeJs. There is none currently. 
  - A Larger data pool to better test the speed of server requests. 
  - A security feature for removing localStorage data when 'expiresAt' elapses.
