<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>To learn how to greatly reduce API requests and response times. 
<br />This is done mainly with RTK-Query as well as NextJs. 
<br/>The website style is a copy of ASOS. I have no intention of profiting from this. It's merely practicing code. </p>


<h3>Tooling / features 	ðŸ¤© </h3>

  * React Toolkit Query 
  * NextJS
  * NodeJs server
  * Netlify & Heroku
